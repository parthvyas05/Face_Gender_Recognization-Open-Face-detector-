# Face Gender Recognition using OpenFace Detector

## 🌟 Overview
This project focuses on **real-time face and gender recognition** using the OpenFace detector. The system processes facial images to identify gender with high accuracy, leveraging deep learning techniques and robust pre-trained models. Designed for practical applications, it is lightweight and efficient for deployment.

---

## 📊 Features
- **Face Detection:** Utilizes the OpenFace pre-trained model for efficient face detection.
- **Gender Recognition:** Classifies faces into male or female categories using deep learning models.
- **Real-Time Processing:** Capable of recognizing gender from live webcam feeds or pre-recorded video streams.
- **Customizable:** Easy to extend with additional features or different datasets.
